## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Mobile Developer** with a Computer Engineering background, focused on building  
**clean, scalable, and user-centered mobile applications**.

My journey started with web development, but I found my real passion in **mobile** —  
where **design, performance, and real user interaction** meet.

I currently build:
- **Native Android apps** with **Kotlin & Jetpack Compose**
- **Cross-platform apps** using **Flutter**
- Products that combine **mobile + AI + real-world use cases**

I care deeply about:
- Architecture (MVVM, clean layers)
- UI/UX that *feels* right
- Code that is readable, maintainable, and future-proof
